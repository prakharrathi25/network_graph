## Overview

Finding an advisor is a crucial decision for students who plan to pursue research careers. However, manystudents struggle to find the relevant information that helps them understand a university faculty well. Toaddress these students' needs, we visualized NYU New York, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi computerscience professors' publications and citations over the years, as well as the diversity of their coauthorsand research labs (based on gender and ethnicity).

[## data]: :
[we created our own dataset by scraping and querying from google scholar, google map, ethnicolr, namesor. it includes 42 professors/coauthors, and 2750 publications details (name, year, citation,number of co-authors) by those professors. for each co-author, the dataset includes their gender, ethnicity, and location, inferred from their names and affiliation.]: :

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to reduce the time students spend on looking into different professors by developing a series of visualizations that could facilitate students’ search on professors’ research information. Specifically, the user could search (locate) for a specific professor, and information about aprofessor’s research works would be presented, and additional information is derived from original data(eg. ethnicity, gender, location).
